Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and API Fundamentals

This project demonstrates the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform along with a foundational understanding of how APIs work in cloud environments. Infrastructure as Code is a DevOps practice that enables provisioning and managing infrastructure such as servers, networking components, and cloud services through code instead of manual configuration. By adopting IaC, infrastructure becomes version-controlled, consistent, repeatable, and automated, significantly reducing manual errors and configuration drift across environments.

Terraform is used in this project as the primary IaC tool. Terraform follows a declarative approach where the desired infrastructure state is defined in configuration files written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Instead of manually creating resources in the cloud console, Terraform communicates directly with the cloud provider using APIs. When commands like terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply are executed, Terraform makes API calls to the cloud provider to create, modify, or delete resources. This highlights an important concept: even when we use the cloud console, it ultimately sends API requests in the background. Terraform simply automates and manages these API interactions through code.

An Application Programming Interface (API) acts as a bridge that allows different software systems to communicate with each other. In cloud computing, APIs enable tools like Terraform to interact with services such as virtual machines, storage, networking, and security components. For example, when Terraform provisions an EC2 instance in AWS, it sends a structured API request to AWS, and AWS responds with a confirmation including details such as instance ID and status. This request-response model is fundamental to how cloud infrastructure is managed programmatically. Most cloud APIs follow REST principles and use HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources.

This project also reinforces the understanding that Infrastructure as Code is essentially an abstraction layer over APIs. Instead of manually writing HTTP requests, Terraform handles authentication, request formatting, and response management through providers. The Terraform state file plays a crucial role by storing the current infrastructure state, ensuring that future API calls only apply necessary changes rather than recreating everything.

By combining Infrastructure as Code with API fundamentals, this project demonstrates how modern DevOps practices automate infrastructure management at scale. It improves efficiency, supports collaboration through version control systems like GitHub, and ensures consistent deployments across development, staging, and production environments. Through this implementation, I strengthened my understanding of Terraform workflows, cloud provider APIs, automation principles, and the core mechanics behind cloud resource provisioning.
